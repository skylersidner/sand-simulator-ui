# Sand Simulator UI

## Origin

This project is based on the falling sand simulator tutorial created by The Coding Train. It borrows heavily from the
original code but with some refactor for clarity and additional functionality.

## Tech Stack

This was cloned from a baseline project which I used from a skeleton from my good
friend [Levi](https://github.com/liester).

Uses [React](https://react.dev/) with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for bundling and a local development server.
[Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) for requests.
The skeleton includes Chakra UI and Socket IO which aren't currently being used, but I left them in just in case.

## Local Development

* Download from the GitHub repo
* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm run dev`
* Navigate your browser to [localhost:5001](localhost:5001)
